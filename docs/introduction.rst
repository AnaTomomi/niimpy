Introduction
============

Niimpy is a Python package for analyzing and quantifying behavioral data. It uses pandas to read data from disk, perform basic manipulations, provides explorative data analysis functions, offers many high-level preprocessing functions for various types of data, and has functions for behavioral data analysis.

Digital behavioral studies using personal digital devices typically produce rich multi-sensor longitudinal datasets of mixed data types. Analyzing such data requires multidisciplinary expertise and software designed for the purpose. Currently, no standardized workflow or tools exist to analyze such data sets. The analysis requires domain knowledge in multiple fields and programming expertise. Niimpy package is specifically designed to analyze longitudinal, multimodal behavioral data. Nimpy is a user-friendly open-source package that can be easily expanded and adapted to specific research requirements. The toolbox facilitates the analysis phase by providing tools for data management, preprocessing, feature extraction, and visualization. The more advanced analysis methods will be incorporated into the toolbox in the future.
