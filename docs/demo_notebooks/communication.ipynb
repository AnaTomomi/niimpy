    "\n",
    "Communication data includes calls and SMS information. These data can reveal important information about people's circadian rhythm, social patterns, and activity. Therefore, it is important to organize this information for further processing. To address this, `niimpy` includes the function `extract_features_comms` to clean, downsample, and extract features from communication data. This function employs other functions to extract the following features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `call_duration_total`: duration of incoming and outgoing calls\n",
    "- `call_duration_mean`: mean duration of incoming and outgoing calls\n",
    "- `call_duration_median`: median duration of incoming and outgoing calls\n",
    "- `call_duration_std`: standard deviation of incoming and outgoing calls\n",
    "- `call_count`: number of calls within a time window\n",
    "- `call_outgoing_incoming_ratio`: number of outgoing calls divided by the number of incoming calls\n",
    "- `sms_count`: count of \n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, we will analyze call logs provided by `niimpy` as an example to illustrate the use of niimpy's communication preprocessing functions."
