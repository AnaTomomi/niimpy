    "GPS location data contain rich information about people's behavioral and mobility patterns. However, working with such data is a challenging task since there exists a lot of noise and missingness. Also, designing relevant features to gain knowledge about the mobility pattern of subjects is a crucial task. To address these problems, `niimpy` provides these main functions to clean, downsample, and extract features from GPS location data:\n",
