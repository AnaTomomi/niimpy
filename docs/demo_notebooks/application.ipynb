    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Application data refers to the information about which apps are open at a certain time. These data can reveal important information about people's circadian rhythm, social patterns, and activity. Application data is an event data; this means it cannot be sampled at a regular frequency, intead, we just have information about the events that occured. There are two main issues with application data (1) missing data detection, and (2) privacy concerns. \n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding missing data detection, we may never know if all events were detected and reported. Unfortunately there is little we can do. Nevertheless, we can take into account some factors that may interfere with the correct detection of all events (e.g. when the phone's battery is depleated). Therefore, to correctly process application data, we need to consider other information like the battery status of the phone. \n",
    "Regarding the privacy concerns, application names can reveal too much about a subject, for example, an uncommon app use may help identify a subject. Consequently, we try anonimizing the data by grouping the apps. \n",
    "\n",
    "To address both of these issues, `niimpy` includes the function `extract_features_app` to clean, downsample, and extract features from application data while taking into account factors like the battery level and naming groups. In addition, `niimpy` provides a map with some of the common apps for pseudo-anonymization. This function employs other functions to extract the following features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `app_count`: number of times an app group has been used \n",
    "- `app_duration`: how long an app group has been used\n",
    "\n",
    "The app module has one internal function that help classify the apps into groups. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, we will analyze screen data provided by `niimpy` as an example to illustrate the use of application data."

Secondly, different phones, OS, and settings change the ease to detect apps. Thirdly, events not related to the application sensor may affect its behavior, e.g. battery running out. Unfortunately, we can only correct missing data for events such as the screen turning off by using data from the screen sensor and the battery level. These can be taken into account in `niimpy` if we provide the screen and battery data. \n",

A possible solution to this problem is to classify the apps into more generic groups. For example, commonly used apps like WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, etc. are commonly used for texting, so we can group them under the label *texting*. `niimpy` provides a default map, but this should be adapted to the characteristics of the sample, since apps are available depending on countries and populations.
