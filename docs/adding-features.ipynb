    "# Adding features\n",

    "## General principles\n",
    "\n",
    "niimpy is an open source project and general open source contribution guidelines apply - there is no need for us to repeat them right now.  Please use Github for communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "Contributions are welcome and encouraged.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Adding an analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "* Please add documentatation to a sensor page when you add a new analysis.  This should include enough description so that someone else can understand and reproduce all relevant features.\n",
    "* Please add unit tests which test each relevant feature (and each claimed analysis) with a minimal example.  For examples of unit tests, see ``niimpy/test_screen.py``.  You can create some sample data within each test module which can be used both during development and for tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common things to note\n",
    "\n",
    "* You should always use the DataFrame index to retrieve data/time values, not the `datetime` column (which is a convenience thing but not guaranteed to be there).\n",
    "* Don't fail if there are extra columns passed (or missing some non-essential columns)\n",
    "* Group by 'user' and 'device' columns if they are present in the input\n",
    "* Use `niimpy.util._read_sqlite_auto` function for getting data from input\n",
    "* Use `niimpy.filter.filter_dataframe` to do basic initial filterings based on standard arguments."
