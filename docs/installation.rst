Installation
============

Niimpy is a normal Python package to install. It is not currently available on PyPi, so you can install it manually from github repository:

.. code-block:: bash
    
    pip install https://github.com/digitraceslab/niimpy/archive/master.zip
    
Note: only supports Python 3 (tested on 3.5. and above).
